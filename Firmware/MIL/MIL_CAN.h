 *
 * Notes: CAN devices should be run at 100k bps
 *        and PCBs on the network should have on
 *        board termination resistors

/*
 * Desc: Contains mailbox attributes
 *       a mailbox is simply where you
 *       will receive data from the CAN bus
 *
 * WHAT YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT CAN:
 * In effect every ECE is sharing the same
 * communication line, in this every ECE can
 * "hear" all messages. With this, your device
 * may not care about every single message on the
 * bus. Given this, you can choose to filter for
 * certain message IDs.
 *
 * NOTE:
 * This is an alternate struct to use for
 * configuring CAN message objects
 *
 * This struct is actually slightly more
 * complex than the TI one, but I believe is
 * more organized. I also believe it'll make
 * function use more streamlined. You can choose
 * either method ,but this is what I created to
 * interface with other reception functions I made
 *
 * This just encompasses more relevant CAN paramters
 * like the object number
 *
 * PARAMETERS NOTE:
 * FOR USE IN MIL_CAN FUNCTIONS, COMPLETELY
 * IGNORE THE msg_obj PARAMETER. IT'S CONFIGURED
 * FOR YOU IN OTHER MIL_CAN FUNCTIONS
 *
 * PARAMETERS:
 * canid - the target ID you wish to filter for
 * filt_mask - which bits matter in the canid
 * base - TIVA CANx_BASE from tivaware
 * msg_len - how long the expected CAN data is
 * obj_num - each unique mailbox needs a unique number
 * rx_flag - only set this variable if you intend on setting up
 *               CAN interrupts otherwise make it 0
 * buffer  - a pointer to your out data (MUST BE SET)
 *
 * OBJ_NUM NOTE: CAN OBJECTS ARE ENUMERATED 1 TO 32 NOT 0 TO 31
 *
